## Course Title:
Web Application Development

## Assignment Date:  
January 30, 2018

## Student Name:  
Cole Sheridan

## Project Description:
Lesson 3 Assignment.  This assignment has students putting 5 key concepts learned from lesson 3 on a webpage, and has students create and use a GitHub account to familiarize how it is used.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control Systems: What are they, why and how to use them, and some examples of Version control systems.
2. The Advantages of Version Control Systems: Why it's a good idea to use a Version Control System, especially when working with a team, and why managing files without a version control system may be problematic.
3. GitHub: What GitHub is, and how it works as a version control system.  We also discussed the most basic GitHub commands that we will be using in this course and a brief intro to other commands and how they are used.
4. Add-Commit-Push Commands: We learned how to properly format the three basic commands of GitHub, used to upload a file to GitHub.  These commands will be used in every assignment, and is the reason you are able to find the completed assignment (and incomplete versions that were uploaded) on GitHub.
5. Other GitHub Commands: While they were breafly discussed in class, there are many other GitHub commands.  Going through the readings, activities, and videos, we learned a plethora of other commands to use in GitHub, including how to create branches, view file changes, and how to download files from GitHub to your local repository.  I am uncertain if any of these commands will be used in this course, but I am doubtful.
