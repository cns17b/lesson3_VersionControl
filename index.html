            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems allow for a system to record changes to a file over time.  To do this, the system, whether local or remote, takes a "snapshot" of the file at specific moments (usually when prompted).  These caputred versions of the file may be accessed at any time, keeping the properties of the file during the moment of its capture.  A version control system will automatically note who changes a file and when, along with the changes made to the file, and may merge changes into a new file.  Version control systems may exist on a local or remote repository, but are usually found on a remote repository in order to allow files to be easily shared by team members (a local repository would be availale to the local user (as a local repository exists on a single machine)).  Using a version control system may allow users to work simultaneously on a file without conflict, and allows you to restore a file to a previous version in the event of a problem. If a file is edited in differing ways, it will create a branch in the Version Control System, the use of branches may help teams work on projects by taking different approachs before merging them into one document.  A branch may also be discontinued at any time if the methods within are found to be undesireable.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Advantages
                <span class="text-muted">Why we use Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many advantages to using Version Control Systems.  For starters, using a remote version control system means that there is no single point of failure.  This means that if your computer or other hardware should break, you may still acess the file(s) stored on the remote repository from any other device, so long as it has connection to the remote repository (in most cases, this just means internet connection).  Another advantage is that multiple people may work on a file simultaneously without interfering with each others work.  The Version Control System will automatically prevent the override of a file stored and shared on the remote repository.  Using the screenshots or commits of files on your version control system allows you to restore the file to a previous version at any time, and for any reason.  Along with this, the backup files on the repository mean that in the event of a disaster, you will not have to start your project over (this is due to the ability to access files from any computer).  Despite version control systems mostly being public, files in the system cannot be overwritten.  This means your files will not be messed up by some near-do-well or miscreant should they end up in fowl hands.  GitHub, one of the most commonly used version control systems, uses peer-to-peer networking, allowing other team members, or the general public to critique and potentionally advance upon works published to advance projects stored on GitHub.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a version control system that stores data in the form of snapshots on a logical manner.  It will not create multiple copies of the same document, and rather post a link to the first existing document of an identical form.  There are three forms of a document on GitHub, commited, modified, and staged.  A commited document means that the document is stored on your local database.  Modifying a document without commiting it means that if something should happen, the changes made since the last commit are lost.  A document in a modified state means that changes have been made to the document without commiting it.  A staged document is a modified document that is marked to go in to the next commited form of a file.  More information on how to use GitHub via its command prompts are described below.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three basic commands to upload a file to the GitHub repository.  These are add, commit, and push.  The add command (git add < file > (no spaces) or "git add ." with not quotations for all files) is used to put a file or multiple files in the staging area for the next commit action. The commit action (git commit -m 'message') is used to commit files to the local repository, but does not put the files on GitHub.  The commited files are essentially staged for being placed on GitHub.  The push command (git push -u origin master) will upload the commited files to the repository on GitHub.  The respository that these files are stored in is determined by a previous command, "git remote add origin git@github.com:< link >.git" (Without quotation marks or spaces.  The link for the repository is given from GitHub.)</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many other commands that may be used with GitHub.  To save time, only common ones will be described here.  The clong command (git clone ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git (with your information in the brackets)) creates an exact copy of the remote repository to your local system.  The remove command (git remove -r [filename]) is used to remove a file or folder from the local respository.  The branch command (git branch or get branch -a) list current branches the files exist upon, using astriks to show which branch (of all possible branches) the file is in.  Branches may be added or removed using git branch [branch name] to add a branch and git branch -d [branch name] to delete a branch.  The pull command (git pull) updates the local repository with all information from the last commit.  You may also view changes made to a file using the log command (git log), and may get more details using git log --summary.</p>
